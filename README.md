Towers of Hanoi, animated in Curses, written in Python3

## Rationale
This project was originally a time killer on a long flight with no Internet.
I had an old jailbroken iPad on the flight with terminal access and Python.

## Feedback
This was not just an exercise in getting the task done, but also in being
as elegant and pyhthonic as possible. Let me know where I can improve.
